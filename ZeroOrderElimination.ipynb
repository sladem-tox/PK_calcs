        "This behaviour is called Michaelis-Menten kinetics which was originally used to describe enzyme kinetics. The rate of enzymatic degradation of a substrate by an enzyme has some maximum, Vmax which along with Km (concentration at which rate = 1/2 Vmax) can be used to describe the dynamics of the enzyme reaction. Since enzymes and transporters important to drug disposition can be saturated the same formula can be useful in pharmacokinetics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This situation could arise with drugs such as alcohol where at most 10 grams can be eliminated from the body per hour (at Vmax). Another estimate (See **Holford, 1987**) describes the Vmax as 8.5 g/h/70kg which equates to a plasma elimination rate of 230 mg/L/h.  The Km for alcohol is around 0.01 % (g/100mL) so we are halfway to Vmax at this concentration. For calculation purposes we will use the value 80 mg/L (just below the 100 mg/L estimated in Burkett) as the Km as described in Holford 1987.\n",
